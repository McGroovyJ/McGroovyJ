- 👋 Hi, I’m @McGroovyJ
- 👀 I’m interested in innovative new tech and helping others excel.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of crypto, NFTs and defi. I'm an early-retired music teacher turned consultant and investor.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that enable access for people with limited capital but a willingness to learn. Also have an interest in PR and good communication which can a make or break the situation for many projects. I can't write code, but I can write in full coherent sentences, lol!
- 📫 How to reach me... you can email me at mcmurray.jonathan@gmail.com
